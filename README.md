## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js** (>=12.0.0)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/datarence-removals.git
cd datarence-removals
npm install
```

Once all dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make edits, and you will see any linting errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Check the [testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for better performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include content hashes for cache-busting. Your app will be ready for deployment after running this command.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot revert.**

This command copies all the build configuration files to your project so you can modify them as you wish. You will have full control over the setup but will no longer benefit from the pre-configured Create React App setup.

## SEO and Performance

This project has been optimized for SEO and social media sharing. Below are the key features included:

- **Meta Tags**: Proper use of meta tags for titles, descriptions, keywords, Open Graph, and Twitter Cards.
- **Structured Data**: JSON-LD is implemented to help search engines understand the site's content and provide rich results.
- **Mobile-First**: The app is fully responsive and built to provide a smooth experience across different devices.
- **Preconnect**: Preconnect to external resources like fonts and external stylesheets for performance improvements.
- **Image Optimization**: Ensure that all images are compressed and properly scaled for better loading performance.
